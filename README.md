# Huffman_Coding
A C++ compression program based on Huffman's lossless compression algorithm and its decompressor

**Compressor and Decompressor has been finished but they haven't been tested throughly they are only tested in linux based operating systems. Use at your own discretion**

## Shortcomings
* Huffman.cpp does not compress multiple files
* Huffman.cpp does not compress folders

## TODO list
* ~~Finish decompressor~~(DONE)
* ~~Add a size checker~~(DONE)
* Improve documentation
* Make it so that name of the file is added to compressed file and translated from it by decompress
* Add a make file or bash script
* Huffman.cpp should compress multiple Files
* Huffman.cpp should compress folders
